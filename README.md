# Verdant
A modern IDE for Verilog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tanishq-dubey/verdant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tanishq-dubey/verdant)

### Goals:
What Verdant wishes to accomplish is simple: make a hassle free environment for verilog that allows the developer to focus on functionality rather than struggling with the toolset. Verdant will accomplish this in the following ways:
 - A simple user interface
 - Integration with system level compilers (Icarus Verilog, etc...)
 - A node editor for linking modules together and viewing flows
